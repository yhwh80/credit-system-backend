## 🐛 **Debugging the Modal Issue**

Since the modal isn't opening, let's debug:

### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Press `F12` (or right-click → Inspect)
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Try clicking "Place Bid" and watch for new errors

### **Step 2: Test JavaScript Functions**
In the browser console, type these commands:

```javascript
// Test if function exists
typeof showBidModal

// Test if modal element exists
document.getElementById('bidModal')

// Test opening modal manually
showBidModal('test123', 'Test Job Title')
```

### **Step 3: Check Network Tab**
1. In browser dev tools, click "Network" tab
2. Refresh page
3. Look for failed requests (red entries)
4. Check if Tailwind CSS is loading
